                   Introduction of Machine Learning (1980s1990s)

1980s: The shift from rule based AI to learning based approaches.
Machine Learning (ML) emerged as a subfield of AI. Instead of manually coding intelligence, researchers explored how machines could learn from data.
Expert Systems like MYCIN were developed in the 1980s. They used rule based systems to simulate the decision making ability of a human expert, particularly in medical diagnosis.

                  Early Neural Networks:
In the 1980s, the back propagation algorithm was developed, which allowed neural networks to adjust weights and learn more effectively. This marked the beginning of neural networks' renewed interest, although computational power remained a challenge.
  
1990s: 
With the rise of computers and access to more data, algorithms for machine learning evolved. Popular algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Decision Trees came into play. During this period, AI started moving away from rule based systems towards data driven models.

                   The Rise of Big Data and Modern Machine Learning (2000s)
 Early 2000s: The explosion of Big Data and computing power. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Netflix began leveraging ML models to predict customer behavior, improve search results, and recommend products or movies.
Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and k-Nearest Neighbors became popular machine learning algorithms.
The rise of the Internet allowed for massive amounts of data to be collected, laying the foundation for more advanced learning techniques.
