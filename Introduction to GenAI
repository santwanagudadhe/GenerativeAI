Generative AI (GenAI) refers to a branch of artificial intelligence focused on creating new content, such as text, images, music, or even video, by learning patterns from large datasets. 
Unlike traditional AI, which typically classifies, predicts, or analyzes existing data, Generative AI generates original data or content that mimics the patterns it has learned.

Key Concepts of GenAI
Machine Learning (ML): GenAI leverages machine learning algorithms to learn from large amounts of data and then create new outputs based on that learning.
Deep Learning: Most modern generative models, especially for complex tasks like text and image generation, use deep learning. Neural networks,
particularly architectures like transformers, are essential in this process.
Training Data: Generative models rely on vast datasets (e.g., millions of images, books, or recordings) to learn patterns. 
The better and more diverse the dataset, the more creative and useful the modelâ€™s output can be.

Probabilistic Models: Generative models often use probability to create outputs that are likely to resemble their training data. 
This allows for some creativity and variability rather than just repeating data exactly.
