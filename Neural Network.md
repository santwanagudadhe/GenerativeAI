1940s - 1950s: Early Concepts
1943: Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts proposed the first mathematical model of a neuron, introducing the idea of artificial neurons that could perform logical operations.

1950: Alan Turing published "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," which laid the groundwork for thinking about machine learning.

1950s - 1960s: Perceptron and Early Models

1958: Frank Rosenblatt developed the Perceptron, an early neural network that could learn to classify patterns. It was limited to linearly separable data.

1969: Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert published "Perception," which highlighted the limitations of the Perceptron, particularly its inability to solve problems like the XOR problem.

1970s - 1980s: The AI Winter
Research on neural networks slowed down during the 1970s due to skepticism about their capabilities, leading to what is known as the "AI winter."

1980s: Resurgence and Backpropagation

1986: David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton, and Ronald Williams introduced the backpropagation algorithm, a method for training multi-layer neural networks. This revived interest in neural networks.

1989: Yann LeCun demonstrated the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition tasks, laying the foundation for future advancements in computer vision.
